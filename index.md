## The TRISEP ML tutorial program
Wellcome to the TRISEP ML tutorial sessions. We have three 1h30 sessions on Monday, Tuesday and Friday, when you are expected 

### Resources
The resources provided to you are:
1. [Introductory documentation and notebooks](https://github.com/TRISEP-2025-ML-tutorials/Intro-notebooks) Setup information is provided here and a sequence of notebooks illustrating implementation of basic concepts of deep learning. Beginners are ancourage to go through this material, while more advanced practitioners should pick and choose the topics where they feel they need some more exposure. This is likely good to do individually.
2. Tutorials/projects - ideally you will work in groups you formed on these projects: 
   - [Beginner](https://github.com/TRISEP-2025-ML-tutorials/BeginnerTutorial) -ATLAS open data based project where you will develop a signal VS background classification fo the $H\to W^+W^-$ analysis.
   - [Intermediate](https://github.com/TRISEP-2025-ML-tutorials/IntermediateTutorial) - A simplified Water Cherenkov detector dataset for classification of few types of events that may occur in these types of detectors.
   - [Advanced](https://github.com/TRISEP-2025-ML-tutorials/AdvancedTutorial) - A point cloud analysis for finding the vertical position of the annihilation event in the ALPHA-g experiment.


### Presentations
On Friday you will compile and analyze your results. We will dedicate 45 min at the end of the session for rapid-fire presentation. Each group will be given 3 minutes to present their results.

### People
The materials were prepared by Felic Cormier, Daniel Duque, Javier Quetzalcoatl Toledo Mar√≠n and Marco Valente + Wojtek Fedorko. Most of us will be in the room during the tutorials. Please feel free to get any one of us for any questions.
